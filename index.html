   <p>In June of last year, I took a trip to Montego Bay, Jamaica, with 11 of my closest friends. We went there to celebrate another friend's 35th birthday. Originally, the trip was planned for June 2020, but Covid-19 had other plans.</p>

   <h3>Private Sailing</h3>

   <!--paragraph about first activity-->
   <p class="funParagraph">One of my favorite memories from this trip was the private sailing. Because my friends like to coordinate looks on trips, we had a neon swimwear theme on the boat. We laughed and sipped countless bottles of champagne, while sailing the Caribbean Sea. The boat attendants danced with us and served us more drinks, then served us jerk chicken. It was amazing!</p>
